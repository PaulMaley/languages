# Project for learning Haskell #
 - Learning haskell because ... why not?  
 - Also studying Freidman and Wand, trying to implement the
 - stuff in Haskell as opposed to Scheme.  
 - Pretty clear I'm no computor scientist.
 - Took the parsing code from Hutton

In the code all `symbol`s (`If`, `Let`, etc.) start with a capital
letter, this is so they don't get picked up by the `identifier`
parser.
